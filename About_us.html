              <p class="card-text">However, Shopify didn’t begin as the eCommerce giant that it now is. In fact, all the founders wanted to do was to build a site where they could sell snowboarding gear.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Shopify Origin</h5>
              <p class="card-text">In 2004, Tobi Lutke, Daniel Weinand, and Scott Lake initially founded Snowdevil to sell snowboards. 
                At the time, few businesses could afford or even access online store software, which was built and reserved for big businesses transitioning online..</p>
                <p class="card-text"> Frustrated with the available eCommerce platforms, Lutke, a software engineer, 
                  designed a whole new tool through which Snowdevil could operate; a software that would become much more valuable than the site itself.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Company overview</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Shopify currently has over 1 million merchants across over 175 countries and $2,929.5 million in total revenue for 2020, an 86% increase over 2019. It also has more than 7,000 businesses using Shopify Plus. 
                This doesn’t come as a surprise since global B2C eCommerce sales are expected to reach $4.5 trillion by 2021.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Shopify, in essence, serves as an attractive alternative for a growing number of firms and online shoppers who don’t want to give their business to Amazon – 
                  and it’s clear that they’ve made an astonishing economic impact on a global scale</p>

          <p class="card-text">When Asphalte was founded in 2016, the brand chose an unusual business model: pre-order.
             Asphalte’s team decided to make clothes solely based on the preferences of customers, without charging them upfront.
             Excellent product quality and a customer-centric culture centered around the pre-order model.
             Also, Asphalte relies on customer feedback to create products. So, people become collaborators and contribute to creating high-quality clothing they actually want to buy. Website surveys ensure that the flow of feedback stays consistent.</p>
